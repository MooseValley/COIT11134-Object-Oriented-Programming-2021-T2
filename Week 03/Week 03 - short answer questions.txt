What are abstract classes ?
Why have them ?

public abstract class MyClass
{
    public abstract double calculateSalary ();

}

MyClass m1 = new ...  // ERROR !


What are concrete classes
Why have them

public class Vehicle extends MyClass
{
   public double calculateSalary ()
   {  
      :::
   }
}

Vehicle v1 = new  ...  // All OK

v1 instance of Vehicle
v1 is an object of type vehicle
v1 is an example of a vehicle





1. What are abstract methods? Describe the circumstances in which an abstract method would be appropriate.

Template or design that you want to enforce throught a project / class hierarchy
Might not know how to implement or have enough information or data to implement



2. Distinguish between an abstract class and a concrete class.

How are they the same ?
How are they different ?

Diff	cannot be instatiated			can be instantiated
Diff	can have abstract methods		cannot have abstract methods 
Diff	Declared public abstract class		Declared public class
Diff	Can contain implemented methods		Must contain all implemented methods
Same	Can have a super class			Can have a super class
Same	Can have a child class			Can have a child class
